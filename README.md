## Getting Started

In the root directory of the project please install all dependancies and start the web server to view & play with the app:

```bash
npm install && npm run start
```

or if you prefer yarn: 

```bash
yarn install && yarn start
```

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your static single page app is ready to be deployed!
